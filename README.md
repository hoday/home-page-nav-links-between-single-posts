# home-page-nav-links-between-single-posts
A Wordpress plugin that fixes nav links between single post pages for custom post types in the recent posts archive

Normally, nav links to previous/next posts on single post pages for custom post types link to the previous/next post of the same custom post type. However, when custom post types are included in the most recent posts display, users may want the previous/next post nav links to link to the next post, regardless of post type. This plugin changes this default behavior only when the single post pages are accessed from the home page. The default behavior is left untouched for single post pages accessed through the custom post type archives.
